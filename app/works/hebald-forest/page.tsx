            During my second year in the MAJIC program (Management of Video
            Games, Image, and Creativity) at Université Côte d'Azur, I had the
            opportunity to contribute to the creation of Hebald Forest, an
            expansive open-world game. This project was a testament to the
            capabilities of Unreal Engine 5, utilizing cutting-edge features
            such as Lumen and Nanite, among other advanced technologies, to
            bring our visionary world to life.

          <p key="paragraph2">
            The development of Hebald Forest was a collaborative endeavor
            involving 19 talented individuals across various disciplines,
            including development, 2D/3D art, game design, level design, sound
            design, UI design, and more. My role in this project was
            multifaceted, allowing me to engage with nearly every aspect of game
            development.
