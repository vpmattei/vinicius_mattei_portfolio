        During my internship at Kentyou, a startup where I worked as a UI/UX
        Designer and Developer, I redesigned their dashboard overview. One key
        feature I introduced was an edit toggle button that allows users to
        easily switch between viewing and editing their dashboard. Additionally,
        I designed a profile settings page that enables users to update their
        profile name, change their password, and adjust various other settings.
        All designs were created using Figma.
